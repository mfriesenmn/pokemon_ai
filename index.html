			<h1>What Even Are Pokemon?</h1>

                <p>Pokemon are creatures in the eponymous media franchise, which originated as RPGs 
                    for the Game Boy handheld consoles. The franchise quickly expanded into a manga 
                    (a form of graphic novel originating in Japan), an anime-style television show, movies, and other genres of games, 
                    such as pinball, board games, trading cards, and even going outside.</p>

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">See the Wikipedia page for a more in-depth 
                    overview of the franchise.</a></p>
            
            <h1>What is this project analyzing?</h1>

            

			    <p>For this project, we are analyzing the ingame stats of the different varieties of Pokemon. 
                We're using the <em>base</em> statistics, which are predetermined by the game's design and largely consistent across the RPG games. 
                The stats are:
			
                <ul><li>Type: Eighteen types, such as Fire, Water, Grass (plant). All pokemon have at least one, many have two. 
                In battle, most moves have an associated type, and the effectiveness of the move is often determined by the type of the user
                 and the type of the receiver.</li>

			    <li>Attack: This determines how strong physical moves are, such as tackling.</li>

			    <li>Defense: How resistant to physical attacks a pokemon is.</li>

			    <li>Special Attack: How strong 'special' moves are, usually attacks that would be metaphysical relative to real world physics or 
                just energy based, such as fire breath, electric bolts, ice ray, and basically anything a ghost does.</li>

			    <li>Special Defense: How resilient a pokemon is to energy or magical attacks.</li>

			    <li>HP: Short for Hit Points, a representation of health. The larger the HP stat, the more points of damage a pokemon
                 can absorb before fainting.</li>

			    <li>Speed: How fast a pokemon is. The RPG uses turns, and the faster pokemon generally goes first each turn.</li></ul>
            

			<h1>What Assumptions are being used and tested?</h1>

			    <p>Since Pokemon are fictional, they have consistent patterns of stats, formalized as canon. 
                    This, in contrast to real world organisms, which generally do not follow design logic nor 
                    balancing mechanisms, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw">though some have humorously 
                        analyzed real world ecologies as such.</a></p>

			    <p>The design of the various pokemon, specifically their stats, is assumed to follow logic and tropes. 
                    For example, Flying type pokemon generally resemble birds in their inspiration. 
                    Pidgey, for example, is a pokemon equivalent of a pidgeon. Birds in nature are generally physically delicate compared to 
                    flightless animals, as the demands of flight require bird anatomy to emphasize light build over structural resilience.
                     As such, it's intuitive that bird-like pokemon would have lower defense and hit point stats. 
                     Normal-type pokemon are generally the closest to real-world vertibrates, and as such, generally do not use energy attacks, 
                     so it would make sense that they would generally have higher attack stats than special attack stats.
                      And dark type is kind of a vibe, not so much an animal kingdom or element, so none of their 
                      stat blocks make any sense.<p>

			    <p>One of the goals of this project is to reverse engineer the design logic of the game's stats to predict what type(s)
                     would be most probable for a pokemon given its other stats so that a machine-learning algorithm could accurately
                      predict the types.<p>

			    <p>We are also testing whether or not machine learning can predict whether or not a pokemon is considered a "legendary"
                     - in the franchise, there are a select few pokemon that are designated as legendary, filling the role in the fictional 
                     world that legends and myth fill in the real world. Unlike cryptids in real life, Legendary pokemon actually exist in the game
                      world, and as such, have their own canon stats and they are often exceptionally strong.</p>
			
			<h1>Challenges to assumptions</h1>

			    <p>Although there is some consistent logic to the stats of pokemon, the actual patterns are highly specific to each pokemon
                     and there are a number of confounding variables and significant exceptions to the trends.
                      For example, psychic types generally take after the trope of 
                      "<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>", of which the iconic Kadabra and 
                      Alakazam are archetypal examples - comparatively high special attack, and very low defense and HP as a percentage of overall stats. 
                      The pokemon Wobbuffet, however, is a psychic type pokemon whose theme is deception and counterattack, and it has an 
                      exceptionally high hit point and defense stats. With only a few prominent patterns, such as steel and rock types generally 
                      having high defense, there were not enough consistent patterns of stat distributions to make any conclusions on the 
                      relationship between stats and type that could be generalized for accurate prediction of type from stats alone.</p>

			<p>Further complicating this is that different pokemon scale differently. Some pokemon evolve, as in an individual pokemon will change into a different form under certain conditions. Bulbasaur, for example, has a base HP stat of 45, and the sum of all of its stats is 318. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur as it levels up, and Ivysaur has 60 base HP and 405 total stat points. The final form of the Bulbasaur "line" is Venusaur, with 80 base HP and 525 total stats. All of these pokemon are the same types, Grass and Poison, but have substantially different patterns of stats. Thus, the consistency of stats patterns doesn't even apply for the same "evolutionary line".</p>
			<p>Even if the patterns were pronounced and relatively consistent by type, there would still be the difficulty of parsing out how multiple types would interact. Steel types generally have high defense, while psychic types generally have low defense. Would a steel-psychic type have defense closer to the median? Unfortunately, extrapolations on those patterns are inconsistent.</p>
			<p>And lastly, many pokemon are polymorphic. Unown is a pokemon where each one is a different letter (or, in later games, a punctuation mark). These different forms do not have different stats, but some pokemon have variant forms such as Castform, which changes type according to the ingame weather - normal type in calm weather, Fire type in exceptionally sunny weather, Water type during rain, and Ice type during snow. Deoxys has several forms, all with the same type, but with significantly different stats. Arceus has a separate form for each type, but retains the same stats in all forms. Furfrou, arguably the worst pokemon, has different forms representing different haircuts. Zygarde remains the same type but changes stats and form as you accumulate more of a rare item called Zygarde Cells. And starting in Generation 6, some pokemon have Mega Evolutions in which they gain a significant boost to overall stats for the duration of a single battle at a time and then revert back to their previous form. These all challenge the model of correlating stats to type and even of gathering averages - would Mega Venusaur be factored into the averages? Would it share weight with regular Venusaur or be considered its own separate contribution to the averages?</p>
			
			<p>Even assumptions about the status of pokemon as legendary or not is more complicated than originally thought. Legendary pokemon have a stat total average of 630, which accounts for 41 of the 800 entries in the data set. However, there are 65 entries for pokemon that are specifically designated as legendary. Many pokemon categorized as legendary, including the original three "Legendary Birds", Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, have stat totals of 580 or below, while some pokemon, such as Slaking, which is literally a sloth, has a stat total of 670 (offset slightly by how it spends every other turn sleeping in battle). As well, most Mega versions of pokemon, legendary or not, have stat totals in excess of 630, and many legendary pokemon have Mega forms. So while stat totals alone are not a reliable predictor of Legendary status, other patterns of stat distribution might be. This remains to be determined.</p>
			<p>There is another category called 'Mythical' which are exceptionally rare, some even only available ingame through limited-time promotions, such as Mew or Celebi. It is ambiguous as to whether or not mythical pokemon count as legendary or not. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon">See the fan wiki page</a>.</p>
			<p>As an aside, in addition to types and legendary status, each pokemon has a "category" that has no mechanical importance and is purely for <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">flavor</a>. Vulpix, which is a fox, has the category of "Fox Pokemon". There is a single pokemon, Arcanine, which has a category of "Legendary Pokemon" but it is not actually legendary.</p>
			
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>After examining various statistical models, we came to the conclusion that the machine learning algorithms would have limited ability to predict pokemon types based on provided stats. Acknowledging this limitation, we applied the models anyway as a practice of concept with the expectation that we would find very low accuracy with the models.</p>
			<p>The status of a pokemon being legendary or not, however, was much more strongly correlated with stats and additionally had a high correlation with the pokedex number (a literal numberal indexing of all unique pokemon) as legendary pokemon were generally at the very end of the pokedex range for each generation. Generation 1, for example, had 5 legendary pokemon and comprised of the pokedex numbers 1 through 151; the legendary pokemon are 144, 145, 146, 150, and 151.</p>
